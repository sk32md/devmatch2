<!--This is to demonstrate the profiles_controller.rb hash dynamic connection -->
<!--     (ruby)@variable(ruby)   -->
<!-- the @variable above links to the @ variable inside the profiles_controller and spits out the -->
<!-- user_id param. Alternatively if we include something like whatyever_path(current_user, anotherhash: hi)-->
<!-- in the home.html.erb and then link that variable inside the profiles_controller with -->
<!-- @variable = (params[:anotherhash]) then we will get an output of hi -->
